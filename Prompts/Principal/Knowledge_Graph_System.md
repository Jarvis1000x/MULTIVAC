# Knowledge Graph System Design

## 1. High-Level System Design

### 1.1 System Overview

The Personal Knowledge Graph system is an advanced, modular framework designed to process, structure, and interconnect various types of information inputs into a comprehensive, intuitive knowledge structure. The system operates on the principles of consistency, self-containment, and preparedness for integration, while maintaining the flexibility to handle diverse input types.

### 1.2 Core Principles

1. Consistency: Uniform formatting and structure across all note types.
2. Self-containment: Each note is a complete unit of knowledge, understandable independently.
3. Preparedness for integration: Elements facilitating future connection to a broader knowledge graph are included.
4. Modularity: Each component operates independently while fitting into the larger system.
5. Exhaustiveness: Thorough and detailed processing of each input type.
6. Flexibility: Accommodation of various input types while maintaining structural consistency.
7. Rigor: Strict adherence to established templates and guidelines.

### 1.3 System Components

#### 1.3.1 Input Reception Module
- Receives raw input from user
- Identifies input type (video, article, research paper, lecture, tweet, personal thought)
- Collects initial metadata (title, source, date, etc.)

#### 1.3.2 Input Processing Module
- Extracts key information from the input
- Prepares content for structuring
- Handles specific requirements for each input type (e.g., timestamps for videos, abstracts for papers)

#### 1.3.3 Knowledge Structuring Module
- Applies the appropriate template based on input type
- Organizes extracted information into predefined sections
- Ensures all required sections are completed

#### 1.3.4 Concept Identification and Linking Module
- Identifies key concepts within the input
- Prepares concept names for potential future linking using [[Concept Name]] format
- Identifies relationships between concepts (prerequisites, related ideas, etc.)

#### 1.3.5 Intuitive Understanding Module
- Generates simplified explanations for complex concepts
- Creates analogies and examples to illustrate ideas
- Breaks down mathematical or technical content into step-by-step explanations

#### 1.3.6 Critical Thinking and Exploration Module
- Formulates questions for further investigation
- Identifies potential implications and applications of the content
- Highlights areas of uncertainty or debate within the field

#### 1.3.7 Personal Reflection Module
- Prompts for personal insights and connections to existing knowledge
- Encourages consideration of practical applications or implications
- Facilitates integration of new information with personal experiences

#### 1.3.8 Tagging and Categorization Module
- Applies a consistent, hierarchical tagging scheme to the note
- Categorizes content based on domain, sub-domain, and content type
- Prepares for future retrieval and cross-referencing

#### 1.3.9 Visual Summarization Module
- Creates or describes visual aids (mind maps, diagrams, etc.) to summarize key points
- Translates complex ideas into visual formats for enhanced understanding

#### 1.3.10 Quality Assurance Module
- Verifies completion and consistency of all required sections
- Checks formatting, linking, and tagging for adherence to guidelines
- Ensures self-containment and readiness for future integration

#### 1.3.11 Output Formatting Module
- Applies final formatting to the completed note
- Ensures compliance with Markdown and system-specific formatting rules
- Prepares the note for storage or presentation to the user

### 1.4 Information Flow

1. User submits input to the Input Reception Module
2. Input Reception Module identifies input type and collects initial metadata
3. Input Processing Module extracts key information and prepares content
4. Knowledge Structuring Module applies appropriate template and organizes information
5. Concept Identification and Linking Module identifies and prepares key concepts
6. Intuitive Understanding Module generates explanations and analogies
7. Critical Thinking and Exploration Module formulates questions and implications
8. Personal Reflection Module prompts for user insights and connections
9. Tagging and Categorization Module applies relevant tags and categories
10. Visual Summarization Module creates or describes visual aids
11. Quality Assurance Module verifies completeness and consistency
12. Output Formatting Module applies final formatting
13. System presents completed, self-contained note to the user
