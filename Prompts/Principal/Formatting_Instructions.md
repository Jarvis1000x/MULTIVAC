Formatting Instructions:

1. Use double square brackets for all concept links: [[Concept Name]]

2. Use the most general form for concept links unless specificity is required. E.g., use [[Relativity]] instead of [[Special Relativity]] unless specifically discussing special relativity.

3. Capitalize the first letter of each word in concept links: [[Quantum Mechanics]], not [[quantum mechanics]]

4. For people, use their full name in links: [[Albert Einstein]], not just [[Einstein]]

5. Use singular forms for concept links where possible: [[Atom]], not [[Atoms]]

6. Only link a concept the first time it appears in a section.

7. Use kebab-case for multi-word tags: #knowledge-graph #quantum-physics

8. For mathematical equations, use LaTeX formatting enclosed in double dollar signs: $$E = mc^2$$

9. For lists and hierarchies, use markdown's built-in formatting:
   - Main point
     - Subpoint
       - Further detail

10. Use *italics* for moderate emphasis and **bold** for strong emphasis. Avoid underlining.

11. For external resources, use the format: [Resource Name](URL)

12. For quotes, use the ">" symbol at the start of the line:
    > This is a quote from the source

13. For code snippets, use triple backticks with the language specified:
    ```python
    def example_function():
        return "Hello, World!"
    ```

14. Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections if needed.

15. For tables, use the standard markdown table format:
    | Header 1 | Header 2 |
    |----------|----------|
    | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |

16. For footnotes, use the format [^1] in the text and [^1]: Footnote content at the bottom of the document.

Apply these formatting instructions consistently throughout the notes to ensure compatibility with Obsidian and to maintain a uniform structure across your knowledge graph.
