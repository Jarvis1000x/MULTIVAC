2. Use clear, concise language in your notes. Aim for clarity and comprehensibility.
3. In sections requiring concept links, use double square brackets: [[Concept Name]].
4. When analyzing the article, strive for objectivity. Distinguish between the article's claims and your own interpretations.
5. In the "Connections and Insights" section, actively seek links between this article and other concepts or fields, even if not explicitly mentioned in the article.
6. Use the "Personal Reflection" section to engage critically with the content, considering how it fits into your broader understanding and potential applications.
7. For "Quotations and Key Excerpts," choose quotes that are particularly insightful, controversial, or representative of the article's main points.
8. In "Further Research," identify specific topics or questions that warrant additional investigation based on the article's content.

11. Use Markdown formatting consistently throughout the notes (e.g., *italics* for emphasis, **bold** for strong emphasis).
12. Adhere to the tagging convention in the Metadata section, using kebab-case for multi-word tags.
13. If certain aspects of the article require deeper exploration, consider using the Topic Expansion Template for those specific concepts or ideas.

Remember, these notes should serve as a comprehensive, self-contained analysis of the article, understandable on their own while also prepared for integration into your larger knowledge graph. Strive for thoroughness, critical thinking, and identifying connections to your broader understanding of the topic and related fields.
