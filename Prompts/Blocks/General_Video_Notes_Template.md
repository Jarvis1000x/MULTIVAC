Instructions for using this template:
1. Do not be constrained by any word limits
2. Always assume the reader has no prior knowledge beyond basic high school science. Explain everything from first principles.
3. Use abundant analogies and thought experiments. Aim for at least one analogy or thought experiment for every major concept.
4. When introducing new terms or concepts, always explain why they are necessary and how they relate to previously explained ideas.
5. Break down mathematical formulations into the smallest possible steps. Explain each symbol and operation as if to someone who has never seen them before.
6. Continually refer back to the big picture and overall flow of ideas. Use explicit "bridging statements" to show how each concept leads to the next.
7. For each major concept, try to provide multiple explanations or viewpoints. Different approaches might resonate with different learners.
8. Anticipate and address common points of confusion. Explain not just what is true, but why misconceptions might seem plausible at first.
9. Use visual aids wherever possible. Even simple sketches or diagrams can greatly enhance understanding.
10. Encourage active engagement by posing questions and suggesting simple experiments or observations the reader could try.
11. Be consistent with concept naming and linking. Always use the same term for the same concept throughout the notes.
12. Ensure all sections are complete and no content is cut off or truncated.
13. Reflect on the broader implications and philosophical aspects of the concepts, but always ground these reflections in concrete, relatable terms.
14. After completing the notes, review them to ensure all concept links are properly formatted, all equations are enclosed in double dollar signs, and all sections are complete.

Remember, the goal is to create notes that would help someone with minimal background knowledge gain a deep, intuitive understanding of the material. Focus on building a coherent mental model of the concepts and how they interrelate to our everyday experience of the world. The goal is to create notes that not only provide intuitive understanding but also form a well-structured, interconnected knowledge graph in Obsidian. Focus on building clear, consistent links between concepts while maintaining accessibility for someone new to the topic.
